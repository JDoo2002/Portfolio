## About Me
I'm a 22-year-old graduating student from RMIT University currently based in Melbourne, with a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology. Passionate about technology, I am proficient in Python, Java, and JavaScript, and have hands-on experience with frameworks like React, Node.js, and Django. My background includes SQL-based database management, cloud technologies such as AWS, and implementing DevOps practices through CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions.

I am known for my analytical mindset, problem-solving abilities, and effective communication, which make me a strong team collaborator. I’m quick to learn and adapt to new technologies, driven by a desire to build innovative solutions with attention to detail and quality.

I am eager to join a forward-thinking team where I can apply my skills, continue to learn, and contribute to impactful projects.
